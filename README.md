# Magical Guide to Haskell

This is a guide to programming with the
[Haskell programming language](https://haskell-lang.org/) that I'm
writing for my nine year old son. I'm putting it in a public Git repo
in case it's useful to others. The target audience is people who have
never programmed before, and don't have a real understanding of how
computers work in general. Other audiences may find it helpful as
well. I'm aiming to keep the writing level at something comfortable
for a third grader.

I call it the "magical guide" because, at various points, I will be
referring to some things as "magic." There _is_ no such thing as
magic, at least in computers. Magic here means "we're not going to
fully understand this yet, treat it as magic." The goal is to not get
bogged down in overly confusing topics prematurely.
