                This is a guide to programming with the Haskell
                programming language. The target audience is people
                who have never programmed before, and don't have a real
                understanding of how computers work in general.

                There is no such thing as magic, at least in computers.
                Magic here means "we're not going to fully understand
                this yet, treat it as magic." The goal is to not get
                bogged down in overly confusing topics prematurely.
